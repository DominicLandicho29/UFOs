- A user can filter by 5 categories
- To filter, simply type specific criteria in the filter box and then click anywhere on the webpage
## Summary
- One drawback of this is there is no option to filter by duration. 
- One addition that could be added to optimize the webpage would be to change the duration data to a specific format that would allow for it to be filtered
- Another addition would be to add a filter button to improve UX
